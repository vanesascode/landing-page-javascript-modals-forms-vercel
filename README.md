# Landing page using Javascript (4geeks academy activity)

- This is a simple landing page selling an invented CSS framework. Ironically, the website is just made with plain CSS. However, it is made as responsive as possible using the `media queries`.

- Javascript is used to make modals appear when clicking certain buttons or sending forms. For example, when sending your email in the intro tagline input or the one at the end of the web (which is sent to `FormSubmit.co`, that is an endpoint for Html forms), you have a modal thanking you. Or when you click on 'Contact us' it opens a contact form modal and when submiting it it opens another modal.

- Finally, the website is deployed using Vercel.

## ðŸ”¹ Setup

- [x] Createa a app.js, an index.html, and a style.css file.

## ðŸ”¹ CSS

- [x] The strategy was identified (see strategy1 & 2 png files in the image folder) - to create the Layout.
- [x] See how useful is to use display flex, and instead of using justify-content-etc, how nice it is giving a % to each element inside the flex div.
- [x] `> *` is a css selector that selects all direct child elements of the selected elements.
- [x] Feel free to create as many CSS files as needed depending on the parts your website has, for having it all organized and being fast to find what you want to change during the development and after production.

## ðŸ”¹ Javascript

Each Javascript file is responsible for a modal in the website. You'll find many notes in them showing you the steps followed to open and close modals.

It's fun to know, that sometimes the Javascript rules worked because of a silly change of words changing, or a Capital letter, avoiding slash notation, etc. Great training with that!

### Something interesting to know - close() method

The 'closeModal' function in the app.js file, was tried to be called just close() when starting this up. However, it didn't work and didn't close the Modal it had to close. This is because `close` is a method and is commonly used in JavaScript to close a window or a tab.

It's important to note that the close() method can only close windows or tabs that were opened by a script using the open() method. Additionally, some browsers may have restrictions on closing windows or tabs programmatically due to security reasons.

Just fun to know!

## ðŸ”¹ Linking the form to FORMSUBMIT

[FORMSUBMIT](https://formsubmit.co/) is an endpoint for Html forms. It connects your form to their form endpoint and they email you the submissions. No PHP, Javascript or any backend code required. You just need to add this into your form section:

```
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/your@email.com" method="POST">
     <input type="text" name="name" required>
     <input type="email" name="email" required>
     <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

The first time you use it, it will send you an email to activate the form and will give you a random-like string to replace your naked email address in the action attribute of your form.
