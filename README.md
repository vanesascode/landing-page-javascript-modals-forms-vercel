# Landing page using Javascript (4geeks acadamey activity)

This is a simple landing page selling an invented CSS framework. Ironically, the website is just made with plain CSS. Javascript is used to make modals appear when clicking certain buttons. In fact, when sending your email in the form input (which is sent to FormSubmit.co, an endpoint for Html forms), you have a modal too. Finally, the website is deployed using Vercel.

## Setup

- [x] Createa a app.js, an index.html, and a style.css file.

## CSS

- [x] The strategy was identified (see strategy1 & 2 png files in the image folder) - to create the Layout.
- [x] See how useful is to use display flex, and instead of using justify-content-etc, how nice it is giving a % to each element inside the flex div.
- [x] `> *` is a css selector that selects all direct child elements of the selected elements.
- [x] Feel free to create as many CSS files as needed depending on the parts your website has, for having it all organized and being fast to find what you want to change during the development and after production.

## Javascript

Each Javascript file is responsible for a modal in the website:

- The 'formModal' file sets the modal for when you fill in your email in the sign up section and so a form is submitted. All the steps are described in the file.

### Something interesting to know - close() method

The `closeModal` function in the app.js file, was tried to be called just close(). However, it didn't work and didn't close the Modal. This is because it is a method and is commonly used in JavaScript to close a window or a tab.

It's important to note that the close() method can only close windows or tabs that were opened by a script using the open() method. Additionally, some browsers may have restrictions on closing windows or tabs programmatically due to security reasons.

Just fun to know!

## Linking the form to FORMSUBMIT

[FORMSUBMIT](https://formsubmit.co/) is an endpoint for Html forms. It connects your form to their form endpoint and they email you the submissions. No PHP, Javascript or any backend code required. You just need to add this into your form section:

```
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/your@email.com" method="POST">
     <input type="text" name="name" required>
     <input type="email" name="email" required>
     <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

The first time you use it, it will send you an email to activate the form and will give you a random-like string to replace your naked email address in the action attribute of your form
